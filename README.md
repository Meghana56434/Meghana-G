#Problem-1.py  
  This file contains a simple calculator class that performs Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division. It takes two float numbers (`a` and `b`) and an operation type (as a string).

#Problem-2.py
  This file generates the first `a` odd numbers. Example: if input is 3 â†’ Output: 1, 3, 5.

#Problem-3.py
  Similar to Problem-2, but follows a pattern based on whether the number is even or odd. For even numbers, it returns fewer items.

#Problem-4.py
  Takes a list of numbers and returns a dictionary showing how many numbers are divisible by 1 to 9.
